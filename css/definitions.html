    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    
    <p>Comment - A comment has no effect on the display of the page that’s styled; it’s for the CSS author to read and better understand the code.</p>
    
    <p>Rule set - A rule set is a single section of CSS including the selector, the curly braces, and the different lines with properties and values.</p>
        
    <p>Declaration - A declaration is generally any single line of CSS that appears between the curly braces, whether shorthand or longhand.</p>
    
    <p>Property - A property is what appears before the colon in any line of CSS.</p> 
    
    <p>Value - A value is what appears immediately after the colon in any line of CSS.</p> 
    
    <p>Selector - A selector is the part of the CSS line that selects what element to target with the property/value pair.</p> 
    
    <p>Element type selector - An element type selector is a selector that targets an element by the tag name.</p> 
    
    <p>Universal selector - The universal selector matches any element within the context in which it’s placed in a selector.</p> 
    
    <p>Attribute selector - An attribute selector selects an element to style based on an attribute and/or attribute value.</p> 
    
    <p>Pseudo-Class - A pseudo-class works similarly to a regular CSS class, except it’s not explicitly declared in the HTML.</p> 
    
    <p>Pseudo-Element - A pseudo-element targets “virtual” elements that can change depending on the actual HTML. </p> 
    
    <p>Combinator - A combinator is the character in a selector that connects two selectors together.</p> 
    
    <p>At-Rule - An at-rule is an instruction given in a CSS document using the @ character.</p>
    
    <p>Statement - A statement in CSS is any at-rule or rule set.</p> 
    
    <p>Identifier - An identifier can be anything that appears as a property, id, class, keyword value, and at-rule.</p> 
    
    <p>Keyword - A keyword is a value for a property and is somewhat like a reserved word for a particular property.</p>
