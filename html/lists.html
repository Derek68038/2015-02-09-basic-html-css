    <h2>Lists</h2>
    
    <p>Lists are an effective way to group like items within the body of an HTML file. The syntax for creating a list is to start with "ul" at the very top and another at the bottom of the list, then input the items you would like to list between that syntax. Each item in your list should be inputted with a "li" on each side. This is to show each item on it's own line.</p>
