    <p>The last item we'll talk about is forms. An HTML form is a section of a document containing normal content, markup, special elements called controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, menus, etc.), and labels on those controls. Users generally "complete" a form by modifying its controls, before submitting the form to an agent for processing.</p>
